git branching
=============

# We use the 'master' branch for primary development. All pull requests should be based on master.
# We tag upon releasing and make as many feature branches as needed for our development.


contributing
============

Please read CONTRIBUTORS. We would love to have your work added to this repository if it meets the high coding standards of this project, has test cases to go with the code and is broken into clear understandable commits. And you sign the contributor agreement.


minitest and rspec
==================

Yes, we have both! And we have so many tests in each, it doesn't look like either is winning any time soon.


deprecated code
===============

* machinist is on the way out, to be replaced with factory_girl
