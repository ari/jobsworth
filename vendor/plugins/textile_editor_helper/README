= Textile Editor Helper v0.2

== Dependency

To use Textile Editor Helper you must be using Prototype. TEH relies on Prototype for the onload event handler.


== To use Textile Editor Helper

Directions to get the helper up and running for your install:

	1. run rake textile_editor_helper:install
	2. for the textarea(s) that you want to add the TEH toolbar to replace the text area tag with:

		<%= textile_editor 'object', 'field' -%> **just like writing a text area tag, same options**

	3. at the end of your form put in the following code:

		<%= textile_editor_initialize -%> **Important!**

	4. save your view and check it out


== Simple vs. Extended

TEH has a built-in mode to show only a sub-selection of available tags called simple. Currently the 'simple' tags are: bold, underline, italic, strikethrough. To create a text area that will only use the 'simple' tags create your text area with the following code:

	<%= textile_editor 'object', 'field', :simple -%>
	

== To modify Textile Editor Helper

Most of the options that you might want to modify (e.g. access keystroke or whether a tag is available in simple) are found in textile_editor_config.js. Pretty straightforward.
