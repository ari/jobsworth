Why is this assignment necessary?

ish group and Ari Maniatis have together invested tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of effort in bringing you jobsworth as a free, open source project for the enjoyment of users everywhere. By taking copyright assignments we leave open the possibility of relicensing jobsworth to commercial entities, generating a revenue stream and building the health of the project.
