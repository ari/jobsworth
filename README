== Welcome to ClockingIT

This is a developer preview, to try and get ClockingIT into releasable
shape.

I've only done rudimentary testing, so you'll most likely to run into
some problems. Feel free to let me know at admin@clockingit.com when
you do, and I'll try and help you get running. I have been able to run
this version on a pretty much clean install, so it should work.

for more information.
