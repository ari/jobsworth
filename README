== Example for Apache conf

  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName *.clockingit.com
    DocumentRoot /path/application/public/
    ErrorLog /path/application/log/server.log

    <Directory /path/application/public/>
      Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride all
      Allow from all
      Order allow,deny
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>

== Example for Apache using mod_rewrite

This will redirect requests for http://server.my_domain.com to https://server.my_domain.com
and will proxy requests for https://server.my_domain.com to http://hostname.clockingit.com:3000 on the localhost
The end-user who is contacting server.my_domain.com does not know that the request is being proxied, because apache will change the "Host:" values to itself as it sends back the response. The proxy request is performed on the localhost, which is informed by /etc/hosts that hostname.clockingit.com points to 127.0.0.1
